# Encryption-and-Decryption-between-users-in-Morse-using-a-Flashlight.
Morse code has been employed as an assistive technology, helping people with a variety of disabilities to communicate. Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, as long as they have some minimal motor control. An original solution to the problem that caretakers have to learn to decode has been an electronic typewriter with the codes written on the keys. Morse code can also be translated by computer and used in a speaking communication aid. An important advantage of Morse code over roCancel changesw column scanning is that once learned, it does not require looking at a display. Also, it appears faster than scanning.
Steps:\\
1.Write a code to encrypt text to Morse.
2.Create a link (program or interface (no external components)) between Morse
and a flashlight and that should blink with respective to Morse.
3.Create another program to record the flash and that flash-toggling should be
again reconverted into Morse and then decrypted into text.
